### different sorting options
* **sort by priority** - you can sort by priority, change from high to low and vice versa.
* **sort by date** - you can sort by date, change from high to low and vice versa.
* **sort alphabetically** - you can sort by alphabetical order, change from A to Z and vice versa.
* **save order** - after making changes you can save the unique order you made.

### control buttons
* **clear all** - clicking this button will delete every item on the list (it'll ask you if you're sure first, obviously).
* **undo** - you can undo your last action if you made an error or any other reason.

### extra buttons for each task
* **mark as done** - the progress bar can tell a task is done only now you decide it's done, there's a button on each new tasks exactly for that. also when you mark a task as done it's text have a line over it.
* **edit** - if you change your mind and want to switch the priority or the task itself, you can you the edit button.
* **delete** - if you don't want to delete all tasks at once, you can delete each task individually.
* **progress bar** - not only that you have a counter to tell you how many tasks do you have, there's a progress bar indicating what percentage of the tasks is done.
