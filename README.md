# My todo list
Hi there! This repo contains my todo list project.

This is my first major project with javascript.

[go to my project here!](https://yairderry.github.io/pre-course-2021-final-boilerplate/src/index)

## my features
* drag and drop - you can move your elements up and down the list (on desktop only).
* sort by priority - you can sort by priority, change from high to low and vice versa.
* sort by date - you can sort by date, change from high to low and vice versa.
* sort alphabetically - you can sort by alphabetical order, change from A to Z and vice versa.
* save order - after making changes you can save the unique order you made.
* search and highlight - you can look for a specific word of phrase and the page will highlight all occurrences of it.
* clear all - clicking this button will delete every item on the list (it'll ask you if you're sure first, obviously).
* undo - you can undo your last action if you made an error or any other reason.
* progress bar - not only that you have a counter to tell you how many tasks do you have, there's a progress bar indicating what percentage of the tasks is done.
* mark as done - the progress bar can tell a task is done only now you decide it's done, there's a button on each new tasks exactly for that.
* edit - if you change your mind and want to switch the priority or the task itself, you can you the edit button.
